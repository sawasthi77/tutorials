Machine Learning
Supervised Learning model
It is the technique of modelling a situation for future predections.
Here we have data that gets divided into 3 sets :
Train data
Validation data
Test Data
So our objective is to create model based on the requirement we train our data and provide validations until we get desired results, and then pass it to the test state
where test data comes into the picture which tests the model that can be used in production environment.



Evaluating Performance:
Model evaluation is done when our model has passed the validation and tests and then
we classify some evaluation metrics 
Binary classification:
whether we have correctly or incorrectly validated our model.
We have trained model on some training data and then we get some test data(that model doesnot know)
after that we have some count of correct and incorrect.

Accuracy:
number of correct predictions / total number of predictions
